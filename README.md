# Anilist-ESP8266

A small Friday night project to use an ESP8266 to query Anilist GraphQL API and display profile data on a mini OLED.


## Purpose
I haven't touched any Arduino stuff in a couple years, so I figured I needed a fun refresher before tackling a different project.
This small project was used to learn more about [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) and HTTP requests on ESP8266.
I used the Anilist API for this because I've already used it in a couple other weekend projects and it is super easy to mess around with.
